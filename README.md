# Climate Change :earth_africa:

## Welcome

While reading latest Bill Gates' book "How to avoid a climate disaster", I want to dive deep into climate change datasets. 
I have also deepen my knowledge reading also the Jeremy Rifkin's book "The Green New Deal: Why the Fossil Fuel Civilization Will Collapse by 2028", which provides a broad economic perspective on the topic.

Now it's time to handle some data and learn!

Here's a list of interesting datasets:
